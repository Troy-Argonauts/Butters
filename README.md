# 2023 Charged Up - Butters

Wow, another year has passed by, this time as a sophomore. This year, we went even more complex with our robot in general, with the amount of sensors we had. In addition, we had PID tuned for almost every single subsystem, which was a pain to do, but it definitely paid off. Oh did we mention our autons were off the charts? We had one for every single situation, and they worked most of the time! As always, we have to link the teams that helped us a ton, without these teams, this year would have been significantly harder.
